# This Is Jeremy's Playground

Just learning some Ruby, Sinatra, JavaScript and such so I can get good at this.

Hey look, Ryan added stuff too.

Jeremy... this is to to see if a) you are paying attention but also b) the reason github is asking for credentials is because we cloned from https instead of ssh. I wasn't paying attention. :)

I'll help you set up SSH next time and we can just re-clone the project.
